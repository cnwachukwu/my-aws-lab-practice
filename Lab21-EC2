Connecting to EC2 Instance

I will be usuing the Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) services to launch an EC2 instance
and then conncect to the Linux operating system of the instance usuing secure shell (SSH)

Note: In most cases, the guessed user name is correct. However, read your AMI usage instructions to check if the AMI owner has changed the default AMI user name.

In my case the username was bitnami i.e ssh -i "test.pem" bitnami@ec2-3-83-137-2.compute-1.amazonaws.com
